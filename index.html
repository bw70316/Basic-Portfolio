		<p><img id="imagebw" src="assets/brian.jpg" alt="Brian Wisnowski" width="100" height="140">As you have probably deciphered by now, my name is Brian Wisnowski and I have lived in Chapel Hill since I was in kindergarten. Naturally, I have grown to become a big fan of the Tar Heels, and I try to make it to at least one football and basketball game a season.  I graduated Appalachian State University in 2009 with a degree in English. I tend to enjoy reading, playing poker, tennis, and racquetball, or at least I did before this coding class enveloped my life. <br> <br>
		While I am musically inept myself, I do enjoy seeing live shows and try to go as often as I can. However, I fear this is another leisure activity that I will have to forego while I am in what can be aptly described as a coding cocoon. I would delve into the TV shows I like, such as <em>The Simpsons</em>, <em>The X-Files</em>, and more recently <em>GOT</em> and <em>Fargo</em>, but I have some more coding to do.
