<h2>About Me</h2> 

<p><img src="N/A" alt="Brian Wisnowski" width="100" height="140">As you may have been able to decipher, my name is Brian Wisnowski and I have lived in Chapel Hill since I was in kindergarten. Naturally, I am a big Tar Heels fan and try to make it to at least one football and basketball game every season. I went to college at Appalachian State University and graduated in 2009 with a degree in English. For leisure, I enjoy poker, raquetball, tennis, ping pong, and reading (fiction mostly). Favorite TV shows at the time of this publication include The X-Files, The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, and Fargo.</p>
