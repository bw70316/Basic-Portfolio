	<!--I had this working fine before class Saturday, but my CSS got mixed with another file I was using before I got the hang of pushing to github. Anyway, the navbar would either stack on top of itself, which it does in this case, or it would "bleed" into the h1 element. I probbably spent 6-7 hours on it in the two days since class and I don't know if its because I was defining things later in the child elements too or if it was overflow/positioning? Not enough clears? I have a feeling I amin the ball park and will need to take better notes when I figure something out I suppose in the future as well as getting in the habit of pushing to github.-->
